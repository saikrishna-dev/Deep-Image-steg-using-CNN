# Deep-Image-steg-using-CNN

## Prerequisites to be installed
- Python
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- matplot
- numpy
- scikit
- Data set needs to be downloaded from here Tiny Image net data set and uploaded in folder under data in the root folder where the code is stored.  https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tiny-imagenet/data .
## Workflow
It is a simple process of execution where every cell in the jupyter notebook needs to be run in order.
It is suggested to run on GPU for faster training.
Everything unnecessary is commented  and simplified to just run the complete code cell by cell and results will be displayed in good comparing format.

## Code
GitHub may not render the ipynb notebooks successfully sometimes so itâ€™s better to use this link or the tool nbviewer to get the preview of the notebook. https://nbviewer.org/github/saikrishna-dev/Deep-Image-steg-using-CNN/blob/main/stego.ipynb
